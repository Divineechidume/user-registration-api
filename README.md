# user-registration-api

This is just me messing around and trying to figure out to create a REST API for login autorization and authentication using NODEJS.

We started out using [this]( https://closebrace.com/tutorials/2017-03-02/the-dead-simple-step-by-step-guide-for-front-end-developers-to-getting-up-and-running-with-nodejs-express-and-mongodb?fbclid=IwAR11i3UiSidEoX9EytKRfBS2gwJ6IAJnPcvnm0pvpzddaVcwlVhcz6kA7Qg) just to get a general understand of how to set up a NODEJS application.

We then ended up referencing [this](https://medium.com/swlh/jwt-authentication-authorization-in-nodejs-express-mongodb-rest-apis-2019-ad14ec818122) for creating the REST APIs.

Currently trying to figure out how to add react to an exitsing nodejs app and will update you as I go.
